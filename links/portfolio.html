         I'm Trenton Teasdale</h1>
         <blockquote>I'm a great candidate because I have the perfect mix of skills and experience that employers are looking for. 
            My background in sales, and customer service have given me excellent communication and problem-solving skills, 
            while my own creativity has taught me how to create whatever comes to mind. I'm also a quick learner, able to pick up new 
            software programs or procedures quickly. In addition, I have a strong work ethic and am always willing to go the extra mile 
            to get the job done.</blockquote>

            I earned my associates degree while I was in high school, by going to a school called UCAS where most classes I took were concurrent enrollment and it allowed me to graduate with my associate’s degree from UVU.
